### Introduction

This is a repository to accompany a reply to Polyakova et al. (2020). It is written in Python 3, and utilizes [X01](https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/employmentandemployeetypes/datasets/regionalemploymentbyagex01/current) data from the Office for National Statistics. It calculates Excess Economic Loss in Great Britain following the Covid-19 pandemic. It uses optimal ARIMA models based on [pmdarima](https://github.com/alkaline-ml/pmdarima)

### Prerequisites

As a pre-requisite to running this locally, you will need a working Python 3 installation with all of the necessary dependencies detailed in [requirements.txt](https://github.com/crahal/Excess-Economics/blob/master/requirements.txt) (generated by pipreqs). We strongly recommend virtual environments and [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/).

### Running the Code

This code is operating system independent (through the ``os`` module) and should work on Windows, Linux and macOS all the same. To run: clone this directory, ``cd`` into the directory, and serve the project by simply running the ``main.py`` file. If updating to future variants of the XO1 data, don't forget to change the string in ``main.py``!

### Structure

_data_: holds the X01 data.
_figures_: holds the figures for the main letter and for previous months too.
_letter_: A letter which replies to Polyakova.
_src_: contains the code for the optimal sarima forecasts and visualisation
